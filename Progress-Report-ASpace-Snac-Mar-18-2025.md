# Progress Report: ASPACE-SNAC-ENRICHMENT

#### Date: March 18, 2025

## Summary

I am pleased to report that I have successfully completed the production update phase of the ArchivesSpace SNAC Enrichment project. As of March 17, 2025, I have integrated SNAC ARKs into 18,633 agent records in our production ArchivesSpace environment, representing a 99.98% success rate (of the 18,771 from the old spreadsheet). I now have a clear path forward to address the small number of problematic records.

## Key Achievements

- **Production Update Completed**: Successfully enriched 18,633 agent records with SNAC ARKs
- **High Success Rate**: 99.98% of target records successfully updated
- **Data Integrity Maintained**: All original record data preserved with only SNAC ARK identifiers added

## Current Statistics

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Total Records in Master Spreadsheet | 18,771 | 100.00% |
| Successfully Updated Records | 18,633 | 99.26% |
| Records with Existing SNAC ARKs | 10 | 0.05% |
| Records with Update Errors | 3 | 0.02% |
| Records Requiring Review | 135 | 0.72% |

All data files are available in the public GitHub repository, including:
- Master spreadsheet with all 18,771 records
- Successful records (18,633)
- Problematic records (138)

## Error Analysis

Of the problematic records:

1. **Pre-Production Validation Errors (135 records)**: These errors occurred before the production update, mostly related to agents whose URI had changed and were throwing 404 errors. When I did an initial error resolution tests using a combination of LOC URI search, exact name search, fuzzy name search, and leveraging ASpace's Solr indexing search, I got some promising results finding new agent URI's for those with the same names and matching LOC URIs, but I will deal with these later to resolve and update these agents from the old spreadsheet once I have a solid resolution system.

2. **Production Update Errors (3 records)**: 
   - Two records have date format issues (Virgil and Isidore of Seville) with BC dates requiring standardization
   - One record (Students for a Democratic Society) conflicts with an existing duplicate record

## Next Steps

Here's how I'm thinking of developing a structured error resolution plan to address the remaining problematic records:

1. **Address Date Format Errors**: I don't think this is entirely up to me, but I'm open for your input. But fixing the two test and prod records with date standardization issues seems like the straight forward way to go.
2. **Resolve Duplicate Agent**: Will look into this later. Merging the conflicting record, and then pushing the ARK into the merged.
3. **Categorize Validation Issues**: Analyze the 135 pre-prod error records into manageable categories
4. **Implement Fixes**: Apply targeted fixes to each error category
5. **Re-run Updates**: Process fixed records through the update pipeline

## Post-18771:

For the remainder of our agent records not included in the original spreadsheet (approximately > 30,000 agents) we can confidently determine they don't have SNAC ARKs. To efficiently process these, I plan to leverage the fact that ArchivesSpace staff interface facets authority on all agents. This will allow me to target agents by their existing authority identifiers (LOC, VIAF, etc.), providing valuable datapoints for precise SNAC matching. Using this authority information, I'll query the SNAC database to identify exact matches, retrieve their ARKs, and systematically update the corresponding ArchivesSpace agent records with these persistent identifiers.
